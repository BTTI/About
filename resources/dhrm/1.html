<h5><u>Classification of computers</u></h5>

<p>Computers are classified according to:</p>

<h6>The ability of storage and performance efficiency</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Super Computer:</li>
        Supercomputers are the most powerful computers. They are used for problems requiring complex calculations.
        Because of their size and expense, supercomputers are relatively rare. Supercomputers are used by universities, government agencies, and large businesses.
        <li>Mainframe Computers:</li>
Mainframe computers can support hundreds or thousands of users, handling massive amounts of input, output, and storage. Mainframe computers are used in large organizations where many users need access to shared data and programs. Mainframes are also used as e-commerce servers, handling transactions over the Internet.
        <li>Minicomputers:</li>
Minicomputers are smaller than mainframes but larger than microcomputers. Minicomputers usually have multiple terminals. Minicomputers may be used as network servers and Internet servers.
        <li>Microcomputers:</li>
Microcomputers are more commonly known as personal computers. The term "PC" is applied to IBM-PCs or compatible computers. Full-size desktop computers are the most common type of PC. Notebook (laptop) computers are used by people who need the power of a desktop system, but also portability. Handheld PCs (such as PDAs) lack the power of a desktop or notebook PC, but offer features for users who need limited functions and small size.
    </ol>
<h6>The Operating Method</h6>
<ol>
    <li>Digital computer:</li> 
electronic devices that process discrete data and calculations using digits represented by number forms in high speed. In this sense, Binary system is used to represent the values of variables and quantities. This kind is the commonest and the most accurate since it can be programmed and used in a rarity of fields.

    <li>Analogue computers:</li> 
electronic devices work on waves principle. They are used in specific to measure continuous flow of data which can expressed in tangible quantities such as atmospheric pressure, temperature, and voltage. They are used in scientific and engineering fields to give round results.

    <li>Hybrid Computers:</li> 
devices that incorporate the qualities of the previous two types ( digital and analogue ). They are used in scientific fields processing necessary data from both kinds. They are characterized by their digital processing the ability to store data, high accuracy, the ability to create arithmetic functions (correlations). Their disadvantages  high cost, inevitable errors, and overlapped programming.
</ol>

<h6>The Purpose</h6>
<ol>
    <li>General Purpose Computers:</li> 
designed for multipurpose functions such as salaries and wages , and processing the storage operation in factories and establishments, analyze sales for they are flexible to assure efficiency , commercial , scientific, medical, and engineering fields.

    <li>Special Purpose Computers:</li>
 designed for specific functions such as early alarm devise and computers used in industrial operations , which may be microcomputers or minicomputer. 
</ol>
